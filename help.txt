> The `convert` command lets you convert a jumble of coins into the highest possible value coins.
> - the `split` command lets you split the result between members of the party.
> - The order of the coins doesn't matter and coin values can be repeated.
> - The result only uses common coins: gp, sp and cp.
> - If you omit the split part of the command. it'll just assume that you want to split the result 1 way.
> Example commands:
> `boh convert 12gp 10sp 1ep split 3 ways`
> `boh convert 12gp 10sp 1ep 5gp 2gp`
> `boh convert 500cp please`

> The "Stash" is a virtual bag of holding, used for storing items and selling them later.
> - The Stash is linked to the channel, so each user doesn't get a separate stash, it's shared between the party.
>
> The `stash` command lets you put an item into the stash.
> - Every item requires a name and a value.
> - Added items have their value converted to the smallest number of common coins. (150sp becomes 15gp for example).
> Example commands:
> `boh stash copper dragon figurine worth 210gp 15sp`
> `boh stash platinum amulet worth 150pp`
>
> The `show stash` command lets you view all of your stashed items.
> Example command:
> `boh show stash`
